# Manual Traffic Count Data

Our basis for the traffic surveying was on the [Department of Transport official traffic survey statistics](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/about){target=_blank}. As a minimum and for simplicity, we set out to count the following categories:

* Cars & taxis
* Buses
* Large Goods Vehicles (LGVs) ie transit vans or pickups
* Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) ie lorries
* Motorcycles
* Cycles

Many Department of Traffic counts even break down categories for LGVs and HGVS even further - including having categories depending on how many axles the vehicles have. As many roadside counts can now be counted by viewing recordings or collected automatically via smart cameras, many counts break categories even further - including multi-axlis categories for HGVs and emergency vehicles. For simplicity, weâ€™ve decided to stick with the more traditional categories.

We knew from the design sessions that the community were interested in counting taxis and cars separately. As these two categories can be easily combined after-the-fact, we have decided to count these as two different categories.

Residents were also interested in counting wheelchairs, mobility scooters and e-scooters as these were regularly seen using the road and pavement in the area.

There was also a strong desire to carry out pedestrian counts in order to compare the number of people walking against those travelling by car, and to create an active vs inactive travel comparison.

To avoid confusion between the category types for large goods vehicles (LGVs) and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), we decided to rename them Vans and Lorries respectively.

As a result, our final modified and expanded categories include:

* Cars
* Taxis
* Buses
* LGVs
* HGVs
* Motorcycles
* Bicycles
* E-Scooters
* Wheelchairs (including mobility scooters)
* Pedestrians
