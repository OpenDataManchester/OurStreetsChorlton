# Introduction

The Our Streets Chorlton project is designed and delivered by the Chorlton Climate Action Partnership, which comprises of [WalkRideGM](https://walkridegm.org.uk/){target=_blank}, [Groundwork GM](https://www.groundwork.org.uk/hubs/greatermanchester/){target=_blank}, [Open Data Manchester](https://www.opendatamanchester.org.uk/){target=_blank}, [Sustrans North](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/our-blog/national-cycle-network-route-collections/2019/all/our-favourite-routes-in-the-north-west){target=_blank}, and [Tyndall Manchester](https://www.tyndall.manchester.ac.uk/){target=_blank}.

Our Streets Chorlton was designed to be a community engagement project that aimed to support the development of a safer, greener and healthier Chorlton. After development funding was secured in August 2020 from the [National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/){target=_blank}, the project runs from January 2021 to March 2022.

As part of the project, [Open Data Manchester](https://www.opendatamanchester.org.uk/){target=_blank} has been carrying out data monitoring and collection, including local air quality measurements and traffic surveys.

A group of local ‘Data Champions’ was formed, with more than 40 residents taking part in the programme, by participating in design workshops, training, data collection and monthly meetups where we explore some of the data collected.

This repository contains data collected by the Our Streets Chorlton Data Champions along with data from the project’s two air quality sensors and other pre-existed data sourced via third parties.
