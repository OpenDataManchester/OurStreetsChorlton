# Data Overview

The data presented here has been chosen by [Open Data Manchester](https://www.opendatamanchester.org.uk/){target=_blank}, the wider partnership, and via workshops with the Chorlton and Chorlton Park ward communities.

Some data and locations relate to work being carried out – such as traffic and air quality monitoring on Darley Avenue outside of Barlow Hall Primary School – others were defined through engagement with residents.

Here you will find the following datasets:

* Manual traffic count data
* Automatic traffic count data
* Air quality data
* Footfall data

## Design and Methodology

Whilst [Open Data Manchester](https://www.opendatamanchester.org.uk/){target=_blank} and its community of practice brings a certain amount of domain knowledge and expertise, we also take a co-design approach to all our projects. As such we engaged members of the Chorlton and Chorlton Park community in two traffic survey design workshops.

These took place in January 2021 via Zoom. They consisted of 2 online workshops where we asked participants to tell us what traffic data beyond the Department of Transport categories they feel is important to collect.

We also asked them to tell us what they would need in order to feel safe and comfortable carrying out a roadside traffic survey in their community, and what extra precautions they want us to take into account given we are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and with lockdown restrictions.

A public Miro board which summarises input from these sessions can be viewed [online](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lWqN_7g=/){target=_blank}.
