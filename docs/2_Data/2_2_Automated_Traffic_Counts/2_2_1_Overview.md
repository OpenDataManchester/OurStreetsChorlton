# Automatic Traffic Count Data

Open Data Manchester distributed a small number of [Telraam traffic counters](https://telraam.net/){target=_blank} to local residents. Telraam devices are cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi micro-computer, which are placed in windows with a street view and are able to count traffic continuously during daylight hours.

They count data on:

* Cars
* Vans
* Bicycles
* Pedestrians
* Relative speed

The cameras can take a few weeks to ‘bed in’ and so data for the first few weeks counts all moving vehicles as cars. It has also been noted that it has trouble distinguishing between single pedestrians and groups of pedestrians. As such, these data should be treated as indicative.

Telraam counts also require daylight and therefore count data times corresponds with sunrise and sunset. All data is given in 1 hour blocks where 09:00 is 9-10am.

Locations for Telraam counters were based on volunteers willing to host them for an extended period of time, and those who has a clear and unobstructed view of the street.
