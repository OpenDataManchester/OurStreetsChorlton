Our Streets Chorlton was designed to be a community engagement project that aimed to support the development of a safer, greener and healthier Chorlton. After development funding was secured in August 2020 from the [National Lottery Community Fund](https://www.tnlcommunityfund.org.uk/){target=_blank}, the project runs from January 2021 to March 2022.
