As such we engaged members of the Chorlton and Chorlton Park community in two traffic survey design workshops. These took place in January 2021 via Zoom. They consisted of 2 online workshops where we asked participants to tell us what traffic data beyond the Department of Transport categories they feel is important to collect. We also asked them to tell us what they would need in order to feel safe and comfortable carrying out a roadside traffic survey in their community, and what extra precautions they want us to take into account given we are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and with lockdown restrictions. A public Miro board which summarises input from these sessions can be viewed online .","title":"Data Overview"},{"location":"2_Methods/2_1_Methods/#data-overview","text":"The data presented here has been chosen by Open Data Manchester , the wider partnership, and via workshops with the Chorlton and Chorlton Park ward communities.

As a minimum and for simplicity, we set out to count the following categories: Cars & taxis Buses Large Goods Vehicles (LGVs) ie transit vans or pickups Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) ie lorries Motorcycles Cycles Many Department of Traffic counts even break down categories for LGVs and HGVS even further - including having categories depending on how many axles the vehicles have. As many roadside counts can now be counted by viewing recordings or collected automatically via smart cameras, many counts break categories even further - including multi-axlis categories for HGVs and emergency vehicles. For simplicity, we\u2019ve decided to stick with the more traditional categories. We knew from the design sessions that the community were interested in counting taxis and cars separately. As these two categories can be easily combined after-the-fact, we have decided to count these as two different categories. Residents were also interested in counting wheelchairs, mobility scooters and e-scooters as these were regularly seen using the road and pavement in the area. There was also a strong desire to carry out pedestrian counts in order to compare the number of people walking against those travelling by car, and to create an active vs inactive travel comparison. To avoid confusion between the category types for large goods vehicles (LGVs) and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), we decided to rename them Vans and Lorries respectively. As a result, our final modified and expanded categories include: Cars Taxis Buses LGVs HGVs Motorcycles Bicycles E-Scooters Wheelchairs (including mobility scooters) Pedestrians Usage and licence \u00b6 Data is provided in csv format under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence.
